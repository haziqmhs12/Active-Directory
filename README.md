# üè° Homelab Project: Active Directory with Windows Server 2022

## About the Project

This is my second homelab project, following a successful WireGuard VPN setup. The goal is to build a basic Active Directory (AD) environment using virtual machines (VMs) and Windows Server 2022. This project is a hands-on way for me to learn about server management, network administration, and the fundamentals of AD, which are essential skills for an IT career. This serves as a practical portfolio piece, showcasing my ability to configure and manage a small-scale enterprise network.

## Technology Used

- **Windows Server 2022:** The operating system for the Active Directory and Splunk VMs
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS):** The core service for centralizing user and computer management
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** The service that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, essential for AD
- **VirtualBox:** The hypervisor used to create and manage the VMs
- **Splunk:** A platform for searching, analyzing, and visualizing machine-generated data (future work)

## üéØ Goals

- Learn how to install and configure Windows Server 2022
- Understand the process of installing and promoting a server to a domain controller
- Practice fundamental AD operations like user creation and group management
- Gain experience with virtual networking and VM configuration

## üöÄ Future Work

The next phase of this project will focus on adding a dedicated Splunk VM to the network. This will allow for the monitoring of actions and events within the Windows environment, providing valuable experience in:

- Networking multiple VMs together
- Data ingestion and analysis with Splunk
- Proactive system monitoring and log management

## üìÇ Project Documentation

You can find detailed instructions and guides for each step of the project in the following files:

- **[Server Setup and AD Installation](installation.md)** - Complete guide for Windows Server 2022 setup, network configuration, and Active Directory installation
- **[User Management](user-management.md)** - Step-by-step instructions for creating users, managing groups, and enabling the AD Recycle Bin
